# wrynn_xl
An excel booklet for making seating charts for big dinners. Wrote the code my first year of university, and figures I would place it here to enable it to be used by others.

Wrynn-xl is a program for making seating charts for big dinners. It is made in Excel, with macros done in VBA to enable the needed functionality. If you have any feedback for the program please place this in an issue, and I might just get to it.

The program can both be used to simplify the process of making the seating charts, as well as suing the _AI_ function to assist with placement.

## The different tabs
Below are a description of each tab in the booklet and what it's used for.

### Start
The start tab is your workplace. This is where you create the tables and place the guests. It also has a menu containg some useful tools. It is one of the two tabs where you need to edit. 

### Gästlista
Here is the guestlist for the dinner. You can paste it in here yourself, from whatever form you used for signing up. The guests info is added here as well, and can be edited at any time. This is the second and last tab in the booklet you need to edit.

### Till köket
This tab is for the kitchen. It will show information about drink and allergy goes with each table spot. 

### Till tryck
Here is a guest-list with just the names that can be sent to printing for seating labels. If they print in the order they get the list, it will be easier to place the labels at the tabel as the names will be ordered in table order.

### Specialkost
This tab collects a list of all allergies.

## Workflow of creating a seat chart
Here the workflow on how to create a seating chart from start to end will be explained.

### Get the guest list
Firstly the booklet must get acess to the guest list. Just paste it into the tab _Gästlista_. It's important that the information is places under the correct header, so the program knows whats what. Also the E column will be used by the program to keep track of which guests have been placed. So don't place any info here.
